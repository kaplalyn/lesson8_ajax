### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson I learned about the AJAX technology. This techonolgy uses all of the previous technologies I have learned in this class such as XHTML, CSS, DOM and JavaScript. This is what allowed our program to load the data of the movie typed in on the same web page without a whole page refresh.
2. I also learned about JSON. This stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It trasmits data between a server and web applications. It was interesting to learn about a technology that is used with social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter. 
3. What I learned about DOM in the previous lesson carried on to this one and what I learned about JSON both applied in this program. I used the DOM element to display titles of the headlines in the program and JSON transmitted the data of the movies to the application.
